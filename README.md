# Energy-Consumption-Powerbi-dashboard
The energy consumption dashboard in Power BI provides a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that empowers users to gain insights into their energy consumption patterns, identify areas for improvement, and drive energy efficiency initiatives.

The dashboard consists of multiple interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) that highlight important metrics related to energy consumption. Here are some of the key components:

Overall Energy Consumption: The dashboard presents a summary of the total energy consumed for water, electricity, and gas. This information helps users understand the overall energy consumption trends at a glance.

Consumption Trends: Line charts are used to visualize the consumption trends over time for each energy source. Users can select specific time periods for detailed analysis.

Comparison and Benchmarking: The dashboard allows users to compare energy consumption across different periods, locations, or buildings. This feature enables benchmarking against predefined targets or industry standards to identify outliers and potential areas for improvement.

Customizable Filters: Interactive filters are incorporated into the dashboard to allow users to slice and dice the data based on different dimensions such as location, building, or specific devices. This customization helps users analyze energy consumption patterns in specific areas or equipment.
